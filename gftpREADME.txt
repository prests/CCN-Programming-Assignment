So this was interesting... I started this programming homework a little late and would definetly be able to finish this part if I had an extra day.

Having one timer was very annoying. I think in the future I'd save the start time in an array for each packet and try that way.

If you want to look at it you can I'm not going to do much for commenting since it's optional. I hope to get some credit because it is a Go back N protocol just inefficient.

Essientially if the time in seconds is greater than the sequenceBase a packet was lost so the server drops the leading packets and starts back from sequenceBase.

I don't print to outputfile because I got tired and ran out of time on this extra credit. Essentially when it was done it would go into a for loop and then add all the packets to a textfile.
